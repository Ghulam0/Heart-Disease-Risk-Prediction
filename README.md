# Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction
💓 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using various health indicators. It leverages machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in medical data and classify patients as at-risk or not at-risk for heart disease.

🚀 Project Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally. Early detection through data-driven approaches can aid in better diagnosis and treatment. In this project, a machine learning model is trained on a structured dataset containing key features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking habits, diabetes, and more.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used includes the following attributes:

Age

Gender

Cholesterol

Blood Pressure

Heart Rate

Smoking

Alcohol Intake

Exercise Hours

Family History

Diabetes

Obesity

Stress Level

Blood Sugar

Exercise Induced Angina

Chest Pain Type

Heart Disease (Target)

✅ Note: The dataset is stored locally as heart_disease_dataset.csv.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – ML model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

⚙️ Model Building Steps
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized feature distributions

Checked for class balance

Model Training

Used Logistic Regression for classification

Performed train-test split

Model Evaluation

Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

📊 Results
The model achieved an accuracy of around 85% (replace with actual score), and was able to successfully identify high-risk patients based on the given features.
